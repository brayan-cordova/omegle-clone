                    You don't need an app to use Omegle on your phone or tablet!
                    The web site works great on mobile.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Omegle (oh·meg·ull) is a great way to meet new friends, even
                    while practicing social distancing. When you use Omegle, you
                    are paired randomly with another person to talk one-on-one.
                    If you prefer, you can add your interests and you’ll be
                    randomly paired with someone who selected some of the same
                    interests.
                </p>

                <p>
                    To help you stay safe, chats are anonymous unless you tell
                    someone who you are (not recommended!), and you can stop a
                    chat at any time. See our Terms of Service and Community
                    Guidelines for more info about the do’s and don’ts in using
                    Omegle. Omegle video chat is moderated but no moderation is
                    perfect. Users are solely responsible for their behavior
                    while using Omegle.
                </p>
                <p>
                    YOU MUST BE 18 OR OLDER TO USE OMEGLE. See Omegle’s Terms of
                    Service for more info. Parental control protections that may
                    assist parents are commercially available and you can find
                    more info at https://www.connectsafely.org/controls/ as well
                    as other sites.
                </p>
                Please leave Omegle and visit an adult site instead if that's
                what you're looking for, and you are 18 or older.
